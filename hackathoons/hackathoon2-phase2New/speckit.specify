# In-Memory Console Todo Application

## Overview
A Python 3.13 console-based todo application that implements CRUD operations with a clean architecture approach. The application will store todos in memory and provide a command-line interface for managing tasks.

## Core Features
1. Create new todos
2. Read/display all todos
3. Update existing todos
4. Delete todos
5. Mark todos as complete
6. Clear all todos

## Architecture
Follow Clean Architecture principles with separation of concerns:
- Presentation Layer: Console interface for user interaction
- Service Layer: Business logic and todo management operations
- Data Layer: In-memory storage of todos

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.13
- In-memory storage (no persistence to disk)
- Console-based interface
- Object-oriented design
- Type hints for all functions and classes
- Proper error handling
- Unit tests for core functionality

## User Commands
- `add <task>` - Add a new todo item
- `list` - Display all todos
- `complete <id>` - Mark a todo as complete
- `update <id> <new_task>` - Update an existing todo
- `delete <id>` - Delete a todo
- `clear` - Delete all todos
- `help` - Show available commands
