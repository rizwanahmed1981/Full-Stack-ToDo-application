# Project Constitution: Evolution of Todo - Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

## Philosophy
- Code is a liability, Specs are the asset.
- Every line of code must serve a clearly specified purpose.
- All development follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology.

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.14
- **Dependency Management:** `uv`
- **Testing Framework:** `pytest`
- **Architecture Pattern:** Modular design with separation of concerns

## Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear division between `models`, `services`, `ui`
- **In-Memory Storage:** No database allowed in Phase I; use Python lists/dictionaries
- **Testability:** All logic must be testable via `pytest`
- **Modularity:** Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive

## Development Workflow
- No code is written without a Task ID from `speckit.tasks`
- All features must have corresponding specifications before implementation
- All code must have associated tests
- Changes are made through pull requests with code review

## Quality Standards
- All code must be documented with docstrings
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Input validation must be thorough
- Code must follow Python best practices and PEP 8 standards

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Test coverage must be maintained at acceptable levels
- All tests must pass before merging

## Deployment Constraints
- Phase I: Console application only
- No external database dependencies
- In-memory data persistence only
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
