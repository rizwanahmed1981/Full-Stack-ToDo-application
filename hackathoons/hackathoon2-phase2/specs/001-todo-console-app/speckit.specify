# Specification: Evolution of Todo - Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

## Project Goal
A CLI tool to manage a Todo list with in-memory storage, providing basic task management functionality through a console interface.

## User Journeys (Basic Features)

### 1. Add Task
- **Actor:** User
- **Action:** Inputs title (required) and description (optional)
- **System Response:** Saves the task with a unique ID and "Pending" status
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Task is stored in memory with auto-generated unique ID
  - Title is mandatory and validated
  - Description is optional
  - Status defaults to "Pending"

### 2. View List
- **Actor:** User
- **Action:** Requests to view the list of tasks
- **System Response:** Shows all tasks formatted with ID, Title, Status, and Description
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All tasks are displayed in a readable format
  - Each task shows ID, Title, Status, and Description
  - Tasks are listed in a clear, organized manner

### 3. Update Task
- **Actor:** User
- **Action:** Selects a task by ID and updates title or description
- **System Response:** Updates the specified task fields
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - User can select a specific task by ID
  - Title or description can be modified
  - Changes are saved in memory

### 4. Mark Complete
- **Actor:** User
- **Action:** Selects a task by ID
- **System Response:** Changes the status to "Completed"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Task status is updated to "Completed"
  - The change is reflected in the task list
  - Task remains in memory but with updated status

### 5. Delete Task
- **Actor:** User
- **Action:** Selects a task by ID
- **System Response:** Removes the task from memory
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Task is removed from the in-memory storage
  - Task no longer appears in the task list
  - Confirmation may be required before deletion

## Data Structure
### Task Model
- **id:** integer (unique identifier, auto-generated)
- **title:** string (required, non-empty)
- **description:** string (optional, can be empty)
- **status:** string (either "Pending" or "Completed")

## CLI Interface
### Command Pattern
- Application runs in a loop, prompting for user input
- Menu-based interface with numbered options:
  1. Add Task
  2. View List
  3. Update Task
  4. Mark Complete
  5. Delete Task
  6. Exit
- User enters a number to select an option
- Follow-up prompts for required information based on selected option

### User Interaction Flow
1. Display main menu with options
2. User selects an option
3. System prompts for required information
4. System processes the request
5. System displays results or confirmation
6. Return to main menu or exit based on user choice

## Success Criteria
- Users can perform all five basic operations (add, view, update, mark complete, delete)
- Task data persists in memory during the application session
- User interface is intuitive and easy to navigate
- Error handling prevents crashes and provides helpful feedback
- Application runs on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Assumptions
- Application runs in a single session (data is lost when application exits)
- Only one user interacts with the application at a time
- Users enter valid input when prompted
- Python 3.14 is available on the target system
- Dependencies can be managed with `uv`

## Constraints
- No persistent storage (data stored in-memory only)
- Console-based interface only (no GUI)
- Python 3.14 environment with `uv` dependency management
- No external database dependencies
- All logic must be testable with `pytest`
